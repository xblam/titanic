# titanic
trying out different types of classification algorithms on the titanic dataset

ISSUES WITH DATA
* missing values for age, cabin (LOTS), embarked
* 38% survival
* cheapest fare is 0, highest is 512 might have to log it later
* distribution of fare is probably highly skewed.



USEFUL FEATURES
* put survived into categorical
* class in categorical
* cabin has many missing values
* embarked should be one hot encoded
* crapton of different cabins and tickets, even though most of the cabin values are missing
* shitton of differen cabins and shitton of different tickets
